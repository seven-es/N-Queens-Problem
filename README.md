# ♟️ N-Queens Problem: Algorithm Comparison and Optimization

This project explores and compares several algorithms for solving the classic N-Queens problem, focusing on runtime performance, scalability, and effectiveness of heuristics. Implemented as part of an AI course, it covers:

- 🧠 **Simple Backtracking**  
- 🔍 **Backtracking with Forward Checking**  
- 🧠📈 **Forward Checking + MRV & LCV Heuristics**  
- 🔥 **Simulated Annealing**  
- 🧬 **Genetic Algorithms**

Each approach is tested on varying values of N to analyze:
- Runtime efficiency
- Heuristic strength
- Suitability for large N

Key insights include the limitations of naive methods, the benefit of heuristic pruning, and the strong scalability of probabilistic approaches like Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithms.

📌 *Part A* focuses on backtracking-based methods  
📌 *Part B* explores Simulated Annealing  
📌 *Part C* evaluates Genetic Algorithms
